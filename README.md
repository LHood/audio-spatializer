# Audio Spatializer

Submission for BrickHack 4. This project takes a YouTube video and runs some
processing and analysis on it to "visualize" the audio in 3D space. The
algorithm powering this will analyze factors such as beat patterns and
move the sound source around you in 3D space, making for an immersive
audio experience. In order to properly enjoy this, you must have stereo
headphones/earphones.
